# Lesson 1
Lesson 1 has presented me with my first deep learning experience. It is like no other coding I have done before. I have been amazed by how **such little lines of code can be so powerful**.

After completing Jeremyâ€™s first lesson I am more than excited to dive deeper into the deep learning world. I found the presented applications really cool, especially how sound can be classified by converting sounds to pictures based on waveforms and then using an image recogniser on these images.
