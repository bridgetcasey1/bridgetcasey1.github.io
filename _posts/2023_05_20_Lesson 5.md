# Lesson 5
I really enjoyed this lesson and being stepped through how to __create a neural network from scratch__! We worked with the same problem presented in Lesson 3, which was predicting the survival of Titanic passengers based on parameters such as sex and fare price.

Data preparation is a new concept to me. But it makes sense. To be able to fit a model to a dataset, the data has to be in a form that can be worked with. Techniques include:
- Use mode values to fill missing values 
- Using dummy variables to convert categories to numbers (e.g. male and female represented as 0 and 1)
- Taking the log of a parameter to convert a long-tailed distribution to something models can more easily work with
-- This will often occur with parameters that grow exponentially such as population 
- Set all data values to be floats

After preparing the data, a linear model was then set-up and trained. The details of which I will not get into but very cool to see the process! Also, the take-away message ended up being that you shouldn't tart from scratch except for learning before Jeremy goes on to show how quickly and easily fastai can do the things we just spent over an hour manually doing. Great for appreciating the magic of AI!
