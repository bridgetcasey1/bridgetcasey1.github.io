## Maths, Maths, Maths!
Lesson 3 covers the mathematical foundations of deep learning. This is extremely important in my opinion as I believe you should have some idea of the foundations and shouldn't just apply methods blindly. I found the theory behind deep learning more complex than working with  fastai however more simple than I anticipated for how powerful deep learning is.

Deep learning is a type of machine learning based on artificial neural networks and I found it cool being introduced to the concept of neural networks as an infinitely flexible function with multiple parameters that you adjust to mould to your data and to solve the problem at hand. This course has really piqued my interest and I have been reading a bit on the topic including this relevant [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mathematics-behind-deep-learning-f6c35a0fe077).
