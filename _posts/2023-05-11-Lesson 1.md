# Lesson 1
Today I embarked on a new journey with lesson 1 of Jeremy Howard's Practical Deep Learning for Coders presenting me with my first proper deep learning encounter. The course focuses on the fastai library, and it is like no other coding I have done before. I am already amazed by how **such little lines of code can be so powerful** and I am sure there is more amazement to come! Also, if deep learning and AI is a topic of interest, definitely check out the course[^1]!

After completing Jeremyâ€™s first lesson and seeing how easily a bird image classifier can be created, I am more than excited to dive deeper into the deep learning world. Several other applications were presented, all really cool, including how sound can be classified by converting sounds to pictures based on waveforms and then using an image recogniser on these images.
