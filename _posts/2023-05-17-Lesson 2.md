This lesson focused on the full deep learning application process in the context of **building a bear classifier**.

After this, **the model is trained and then the data is cleaned**. Yes, you heard me correctly. I found this part of the lesson surprising as it makes more sense to me to clean the data and then train the model but by the end of the lesson I was convinced that this was the way to do it.
