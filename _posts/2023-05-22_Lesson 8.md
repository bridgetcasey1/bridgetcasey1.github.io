# Lesson 8
The last lesson! I have learnt a ridiculous amount during this course and feel it is only scraping the surface of deep learning and AI. I'm glad CNNs (convolutional neural networks) were discussed this lesson as it is a term I always that hear about in deep learning discussions but until this course really had no idea what they referred to. I always thought it was a very abstract concept however through the course have realised a neural network is just a mathematical function. 

A standard neural network is presented in this lesson which:
1. Multiplies each input by a number of values (parameters)
2. Sums these for each group of values
3. Replaces the negative numbers with zeros

This process is repeated to increase the number of layers of the neural network, with the input of one layer feeding into the next.

So, what do we do with this? As the initial parameter values are chosen randomly, the neural network at first has no real function but these parameters can be adjusted using gradient descent to fit the data at hand. This allows application to so many different problems! For me, this lesson made the concepts of deep learning and fine-tuning pretrained models, which I have been doing for the duration of course, a lot clearer! Overall, a great course and very grateful to Jeremy for sharing his wisdom[^1].
